# ‚≠ê Project 18 - Task Planning & Model Solution

## üìå Project Overview
I performed **exploratory data analysis and structured planning** for a project requiring model development and evaluation.  
The goal was to clarify requirements, outline a step-by-step plan, implement solutions, and report results clearly.

## üéØ My Objectives
- Analyze the dataset and understand task requirements.  
- Identify key clarifying questions to discuss with the team lead.  
- Develop a **3-5 step plan** to solve the tasks, with explanations for each step.  
- Implement the solution in code, train and test models if required.  
- Prepare a final report addressing:
  - Steps completed vs. omitted and why  
  - Challenges and how they were resolved  
  - Key steps to solve the task  
  - Final model choice and quality metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è My Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration
- Load dataset and inspect structure, missing values, and anomalies.  
- Visualize data patterns relevant to the task.

### 2. Task Clarification & Planning
- List questions for team lead to clarify requirements.  
- Define a clear step-by-step plan for task completion (3-5 steps).  

### 3. Solution Implementation
- Write code according to the plan.  
- Train and test models if part of the task.  
- Document intermediate results and observations.

### 4. Evaluation & Reporting
- Check that the solution meets task conditions.  
- Evaluate model quality if applicable.  
- Prepare a final report answering key questions:
  - Steps completed vs omitted  
  - Challenges and solutions  
  - Key actions for task completion  
  - Final model and quality metrics
