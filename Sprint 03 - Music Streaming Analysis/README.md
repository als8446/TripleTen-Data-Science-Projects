# 📊 Project 03 - Music Streaming Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
For this project, I analyzed **real music streaming data** to explore and process user listening habits in **Springfield** and **Shelbyville**.  
As part of the analytics team, my role was to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset to identify **patterns in user activity** and provide actionable insights.

## 🎯 My Objectives  
- Describe the dataset and understand its structure.  
- Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing and duplicate values.  
- Analyze user activity patterns by **day of the week** and **city**.  
- Summarize findings to support data-driven decision-making.
