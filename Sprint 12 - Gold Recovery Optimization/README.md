Project 12: Time Series Forecasting for Taxi Orders

Project Description

As part of the analytics team, my task in this project was to develop a predictive model for time series data in order to forecast the number of taxi orders for the upcoming hour. This prediction allows the company to proactively manage resources, balance driver supply with customer demand, and reduce waiting times.

The project required me to work with historical data, apply time series analysis techniques, and train regression models to generate reliable forecasts.

Objectives
	•	Analyze historical taxi order data to identify seasonality, trends, and patterns.
	•	Prepare features such as time-based lags, rolling means, and seasonal indicators.
	•	Train machine learning models (regression-based) to predict the next-hour demand.
	•	Evaluate model performance using RMSE and select the most accurate approach.

Key Steps
	1.	Data Exploration & Preprocessing
	•	Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and converted timestamps to proper datetime format.
	•	Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover daily and weekly demand cycles.
	2.	Feature Engineering
	•	Created lag features, rolling averages, and encoded cyclical time elements (hour of day, day of week).
	•	Normalized and scaled the data for optimal model performance.
	3.	Model Development
	•	Tested multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.
	•	Tuned hyperparameters to improve forecast accuracy.
	4.	Evaluation & Results
	•	Selected the best-performing model based on RMSE.
	•	Demonstrated that the model successfully captured seasonal trends and produced reliable demand forecasts.

Tools & Libraries
	•	Python
	•	Pandas, NumPy (data processing)
	•	Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations)
	•	Scikit-learn (modeling & evaluation)
	•	Statsmodels (time series analysis)

Outcome

The final model achieved strong predictive accuracy, providing actionable insights for resource planning. With this solution, the company can better anticipate demand surges and improve operational efficiency by deploying drivers where and when they are most needed.
