# 📊 Project 02 - Customer Segmentation & Consumption Trends  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project continues the work I started in **Project 01 - Customer Loyalty Program Preparation**.  
As part of the data analytics team at **Store 1**, my role in this second phase was to go beyond data cleaning and focus on more advanced analysis.  

The company needed to gain deeper insights into customer behavior in order to improve the **personalization of advertising campaigns**.  
To achieve this, I performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with two main goals:  
- Segment customers into meaningful groups.  
- Analyze **consumption trends over time**.

## 🎯 My Objectives  
- Segment customers based on their demographics, purchase history, and spending behavior.  
- Explore consumption patterns across time and product categories.  
- Identify key insights that could help optimize loyalty and advertising campaigns.  
- Strengthen my ability to handle more complex datasets and real-world analytical challenges compared to Project 01.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
For this project, I worked with the **cleaned dataset from Project 01**, which was enriched to allow more detailed analysis.  

It included:  
- Customer profile information.  
- Historical purchase records.  
- Variables to group customers and analyze their behavior over time.
