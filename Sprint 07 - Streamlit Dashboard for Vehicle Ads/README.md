# ⭐ Project 07 - Streamlit Dashboard for Vehicle Ads

## 📌 Project Overview
As part of my software engineering practice, I developed a **web application using Streamlit** to visualize and explore a dataset of vehicle ads (`vehicles_us.csv`).  
The project focused on **software engineering tasks**: creating virtual environments, managing packages, using GitHub for version control, and deploying a web app on Render.

## 🎯 My Objectives
- Set up a Python virtual environment and install packages (pandas, plotly, streamlit).  
- Create a GitHub repository and add a README.md and .gitignore.  
- Perform basic **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** in a Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`).  
- Develop a **Streamlit web application** (`app.py`) that includes:  
  - Header text  
  - Button or checkbox to build an interactive histogram using Plotly  
  - Optional scatter plot for additional visualization  
- Deploy the web app to Render.com and make it publicly accessible.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset (`vehicles_us.csv`) contains car listings with typical vehicle information such as odometer readings, prices, year, and other features. The focus of this project was **web app development**, so the dataset is used mainly to populate visualizations interactively.

## 🛠️ My Workflow
1. **Setup & Environment:**
   - Created `vehicles_env` virtual environment.
   - Installed pandas, plotly, and streamlit.
   - Configured VS Code and cloned GitHub repository.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Loaded dataset in `EDA.ipynb`.
   - Built visualizations with Plotly.
3. **Web App Development:**
   - Created `app.py` with Streamlit.
   - Added header, interactive histogram, and scatter plot.
   - Enabled button/checkbox interactivity.
4. **Deployment:**
   - Connected GitHub repo to Render.com.
   - Configured build and start commands.
   - Verified deployment and accessibility online.
