# 📊 Project 04 - Instacart Customer Purchase Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
For this project, I analyzed **Instacart data** to explore and understand customer grocery shopping habits.  
As part of the analytics team, my role was to **clean, preprocess, and analyze multiple datasets** to uncover patterns in purchasing behavior.  

The project involved multiple datasets and required careful handling of **missing values and duplicates** to ensure accurate analysis.

## 🎯 My Objectives  
- Examine the structure of all provided datasets.  
- Clean and preprocess data, correcting types, handling missing and duplicate values.  
- Analyze ordering patterns by **hour of day** and **day of week**.  
- Compare distributions of orders between specific days (e.g., Wednesday vs. Saturday).  
- Identify top products, frequently reordered items, and first items added to carts.  
- Summarize customer purchasing behavior and generate actionable insights.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The project uses five datasets:  

| File                   | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `instacart_orders.csv` | Each row represents a customer order, including order number, day, hour, and days since prior order. |
| `products.csv`         | Contains product IDs, names, aisle IDs, and department IDs. |
| `order_products.csv`   | Lists all products in each order, including sequence in cart and reorder status. |
| `aisles.csv`           | Maps aisle IDs to aisle names. |
| `departments.csv`      | Maps department IDs to department names. |

## 🛠️ My Workflow  
1. **Load and inspect datasets** to understand their structure.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Correct data types for IDs and numeric columns.  
   - Handle missing values and duplicates, documenting the approach.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualize order patterns by hour and day of week.  
   - Compare distributions of orders for specific days.  
   - Identify top products, frequently reordered items, and first-added items.  
   - Analyze order quantities and reorder rates per customer.  
4. **Summarize insights:**  
   - Provide visualizations with titles, axis labels, and legends.  
   - Write conclusions in Markdown summarizing customer purchasing behavior.
