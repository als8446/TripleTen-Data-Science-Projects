# TripleTen-Data-Science-Projects

These are the projects I made in the Data Scientist course in TripleTen LatAm.

They involve data Preprocessing, data analysis as well as statistical analysis. Some of them involve the creation of a Machine Learning models.

| Data Preprocessing            | Customer Loyalty Program Preparation         | The e-commerce company **Store 1** is preparing the launch of a new Customer Loyalty Program. The goal is to analyze and clean its customer database to ensure data is complete, consistent, and ready for analysis. This includes cleaning customer profiles, standardizing names and ages, calculating total spending, and validating data consistency. | Python, pandas, data cleaning, preprocessing, KPIs |
| Exploratory Data Analysis     | Customer Segmentation & Consumption Trends  | In the final stage of the project, I focused on **customer segmentation** and **analyzing consumption trends over time** for Store 1, using enriched datasets to gain deeper insights and improve personalized marketing campaigns. | Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, data analysis, customer segmentation |
| Exploratory Data Analysis     | Music Streaming Analysis                      | I worked with **real music streaming data** from Springfield and Shelbyville to explore and process user listening habits. This included describing the dataset, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and analyzing activity patterns by city and day of the week. | Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, data cleaning, EDA, time series analysis |
